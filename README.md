# Isosurfaces

Constructs isolines of a given two-dimensional scalar field, i.e. curves over which `f(x,y)=0` for a given real-valued function `f(x,y)`.

This is designed to be simple and extensible (soonâ„¢) to three- and four- dimensional scalar fields.

Currently building this as a ground-up rewrite of [my past attempt](https://github.com/jared-hughes/iso_simplicial), which was poorly-designed.

Other terms for an isoline:

- Contour
- Level curve
- Topographic map
